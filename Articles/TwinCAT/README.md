# TwinCAT Programming Articles

Welcome to my collection of TwinCAT programming articles! This section contains practical guides and tutorials for working with Beckhoff TwinCAT, a powerful PLC programming environment based on CODESYS and the IEC 61131-3 standard.

## About TwinCAT

TwinCAT (The Windows Control and Automation Technology) is Beckhoff's PC-based control platform that enables real-time control on standard PC hardware. It supports all five IEC 61131-3 programming languages:

- **ST (Structured Text)** - Pascal/C-like programming
- **LD (Ladder Diagram)** - Relay logic representation  
- **FBD (Function Block Diagram)** - Graphical programming with function blocks
- **SFC (Sequential Function Chart)** - Sequential process programming
- **IL (Instruction List)** - Assembly-like programming (deprecated)

## Articles Overview
